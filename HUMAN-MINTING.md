# A New Paradigm for Minting Money: Empowering Every Individual

## Abstract

The current economic systems allow only states and banks to issue money, leading to monopolistic control over monetary resources. This paper proposes a new paradigm where every productive individual has the capability to mint money. This new system shifts the power from centralized institutions to individuals, enabling a fair and productive use of human energy and time. The paper rationalizes the necessity of this system, drawing comparisons with Bitcoin's early days and arguing against Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a long-term solution.

## Introduction

The traditional financial systems are built on the premise that states and banks are the sole issuers of money. This system of complete control on money printing, it has also led to an uneven distribution of monetary power, where individuals and corporations with connections into banking and state apparatus, have gained monetary advantages. This paper proposes a revolutionary change where every productive individual can mint money through their productive efforts. This decentralized approach aims to create a more equitable and productive society.

## Historical Context: The Case of Bitcoin

Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, introduced a new way of minting money through mining. In its early days, anyone with a computer could mine Bitcoin, democratizing the creation of money. However, as the network grew, mining became an exclusive domain for individuals and corporations with significant financial resources. This paper envisions a system that retains Bitcoin's initial inclusivity and extends it to every productive individual, and not just in the beginning, but as a permanent feature of the system, even for future generations.

## Why Universal Basic Income is Not the Solution

Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been proposed as a means to ensure a basic standard of living for all. However, it may lead to increased reluctance to perform productive work and stifle creativity and innovation. Instead of providing a fixed income regardless of productivity, this paper advocates for a system where individuals earn money based on their productive contributions.

## The New System: Human Capital as the Basis for Money

In this proposed system, humans are the capital. Individuals mint money through the productive use of their energy and time. Various activities, such as creative endeavors, educational pursuits, and community service, would be recognized as productive efforts. This approach ensures that money is directly tied to the value created by individuals, fostering a culture of innovation and productivity.

## Impossible calculations

It is impossible for any humans or computer system to differentiate the value of one person's work from another. The value of a person's work is subjective and can only be determined by the person who is willing to pay for it. This new system of minting money, will not differentiate between the value of one person's work from another. It will be a system that will allow every person to mint money based on their productive efforts and gain the equal amount of money for their time.

## Making Money is not Trading

The process of minting money is not a trading process. It is a process of creating money based on the productive efforts of individuals.

## Trading in the new economy

While everyone has an eqal opportunity to mint new money, we all have different needs and wants. When performing trades for goods and services with this new kind of money, the value of the goods and services will be determined by the individuals involved in the trade.

## Mechanism of Implementation

1. Validation of Productivity: A decentralized network would validate the productive efforts of individuals. This could involve community voting, smart contracts, or a combination of both.

2. Minting Process: Once productivity is validated, individuals would mint new units of money. The process would be transparent, ensuring that the value created is reflected in the newly minted money.

3. Usage and Exchange: The newly minted money could be used for transactions, savings, or investments, just like traditional money. It would be accepted by businesses and individuals who recognize the value created through productivity.

## Benefits of the Proposed System

- Equity: By enabling every individual to mint money, the system promotes fairness and reduces economic disparity.

- Incentive for Productivity: Tying money creation to productive efforts incentivizes individuals to contribute positively to society.

- Innovation and Creativity: The system encourages diverse forms of productivity, fostering creativity and innovation.

## Conclusion

This paper advocates for a fundamental shift in the way money is created and distributed. By empowering individuals to mint money through productive efforts, we can build a more equitable and innovative society. The proposed system leverages the strengths of decentralized networks, drawing inspiration from Bitcoin's early days, while addressing the shortcomings of UBI. This paradigm shift is essential for a future where human capital is the true measure of economic value.

Another way to describe this process, is **Human-Proof-of-Work** (HPoW).
